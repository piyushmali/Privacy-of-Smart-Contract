# Privacy of Smart Contract

## Overview

The **Privacy of Smart Contract** project is an exploration into enhancing the privacy, security, and efficiency of smart contracts on public blockchains. This repository contains multiple implementations leveraging cutting-edge cryptographic techniques such as Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and zk-SNARKs to address various vulnerabilities and privacy concerns in blockchain-based systems.

The project is organized into four main components:

1. **SecureSmartContractTOD**: A framework that mitigates Transaction-Ordering Dependency (TOD) in smart contracts.
2. **ZKProofPrivacy**: Implementation of privacy-preserving smart contracts using zk-SNARKs.
3. **zk-snarks-project**: A detailed exploration of zk-SNARKs for enhancing transaction privacy.
4. **ZKTrust**: A framework that combines ZKP with multi-source data verification to enhance the trust and privacy of smart contracts.

## Components

### 1. SecureSmartContractTOD

**ZK-OrderGuard**: This framework is designed to mitigate Transaction-Ordering Dependency (TOD), a critical vulnerability in smart contracts. It uses a zero-knowledge-based transaction ordering mechanism to ensure fair and secure transaction processing. The framework includes:

- **SecureContract Module**: Smart contract logic for setting and claiming rewards while preventing TOD.
- **Zero-Knowledge Verifier**: A ZKP-based system to validate transaction correctness and order without exposing details.
- **Transaction Queue**: Prioritizes transactions to prevent manipulation.
- **Event-Driven Engine**: Ensures that transactions are executed securely in the correct order.

**Performance**: The framework processes transactions at an average rate of 15 TPS, with minimal latency and a slight overhead in gas costs, providing strong resistance to front-running attacks.

### 2. ZKProofPrivacy

This component focuses on privacy-preserving smart contracts using **zk-SNARKs**. The implementation allows for confidential transactions on public blockchains like Ethereum. Key phases include:

- **Circuit Design and Compilation**: Using the ZoKrates toolkit to define and compile arithmetic circuits.
- **Trusted Setup**: Generation of proving and verification keys.
- **Proof Generation**: Validation of transaction correctness without revealing sensitive information.
- **Smart Contract Deployment**: Deploying the verifier contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Transaction Verification**: Ensuring privacy-preserving transactions are processed efficiently.

**Comparison**: zk-SNARKs offer superior privacy, scalability, and efficiency compared to homomorphic encryption, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), and private transactions like Monero.

### 3. zk-snarks-project

This project further explores zk-SNARKs, emphasizing their implementation within Ethereum smart contracts to enhance transaction privacy while maintaining scalability and efficiency. It compares zk-SNARKs with other privacy mechanisms, demonstrating their superiority in maintaining transaction confidentiality.

**Results**: zk-SNARKs prove to be computationally efficient for high-value transactions, scalable for large-scale applications, and secure against various privacy threats.

### 4. ZKTrust

**ZKTrust** is a novel framework that enhances privacy and trust in smart contracts by leveraging ZKP and multi-source data verification. It operates on the zkSync Layer 2 blockchain, providing:

- **Privacy**: Ensures that sensitive data feeds in smart contracts remain confidential.
- **Trustworthiness**: Utilizes multi-source verification to ensure data accuracy and reliability.
- **Scalability**: Benefits from zkSync's Layer 2 architecture for improved performance in decentralized applications (dApps).

**Use Cases**: ZKTrust is suitable for applications requiring secure and reliable data, such as financial services, supply chain management, and healthcare.
